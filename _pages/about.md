My name is Zirui Li, and I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Rutgers University. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm now working with [Prof. Yipeng Huang](https://yipenghuang.com/) on quantum computing system. My research interests are quantum algorithm compiler, quantum circuit cutting and quantum noise simulation.
